// statistics.h
//

// This file contains the interface for the statistics class
// which can be setup to dynamically track statistics within a
// C++ program.

// This is essentially a (poor-man's) simplified version of gprof.

// My intent here is to allow the StatisticsMgr to be used with very little
// setup on the part of the client.  Notice that you don't need to setup
// all the statistics that you will be tracking.  You just Register the
// statistic as you go.  In the end the Print or Get methods will allow you
// to report all the statistics.

// Andre Bergholz, who was the TA for the 2000 offering, has written
// some (or probably all) of this code.
